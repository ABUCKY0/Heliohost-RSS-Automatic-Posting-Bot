## Project Notes

1. I had to develop an instagram posting bot *without* an Instagram account since I don't want to have a ton of social media accounts.
2. HelioHost's RSS Feed doesn't have ETags, meaning I had to develop a way to check the last post using another method  
  a. (I did this using the post's time btw)
3. I take no credit in the background image that the image generation uses. (I Forgot what their name was replace this text later when you have a chance) created the background image and helped find the fonts used. They also suggested that I generate multiple images for the instagram post, which took a bit of testing to get right.
4. I had to replace HTML tags with their real text counterparts, which was fun to make.
